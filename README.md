# YouTube-dl2HTML
Create a java gui with youtube-dl to replace the some of the basic functionality of the defuct BYTubeD

Currently a quick and dirty alpha to prove the concept.
Place in folder with youtube-dl.exe where it will keep it's files.
Open and place links in text area.
Press get button.
If you don't have youtube-dl.exe it will prompt you to download it and restart.
It creates a html file with the links and open them up in your default browser.
A separate html is created for any errors.
